---
Allison Marietta is a freelance writer and also finds herself as an assistant cross country coach, substitute teacher, and seasonal fireworks saleswoman. She graduated from Saint Louis University in only three years in May 2025 summa cum laude with degrees in Research Intensive English and Spanish, where she was also a Division I softball student-athlete. At SLU, she was involved in the Honors Program, Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, St. Edmund Campion Society, Her Campus magazine, and The Kiln Project & VIA literary magazine and research journal. She is currently taking a gap year to dedicate time to writing, traveling, and living life to the fullest.

She is passionate about writing fiction but also enjoys chronicling her many travels, her experiences as an athlete and a human, and her gap year journey. She loves Christmas-scented candles, music, gluten-free baked goods, romantic comedies, and yoga. She has completed two half marathons and is avidly training for her third. You can almost always find her with a protein latte and book in hand.
