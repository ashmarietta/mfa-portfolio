Though she was not raised a city girl, Allie was an avid explorer of St. Louis, where she graduated with degrees in English and Spanish from Saint Louis University. On campus, she was on the softball team and was involved in the Honors program, Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, St. Edmund Campion Society, and, of course, Her Campus. She loves travel, music, Christmas-scented candles, gluten-free baked goods, romantic comedies, and yoga. You can almost always find her with a protein latte and book in hand.
