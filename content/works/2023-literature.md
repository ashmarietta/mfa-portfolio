FIX INDENTS!!

One of the joys of being an English major is being able to appreciate reading. Granted, I have been a bookworm my entire life, using every spare minute of car rides to get to the next chapter. During my first semester of freshman year, I noticed that I couldn’t consume books at the rate I did when I was younger since General Biology and Calculus were soaking up my free time like a sponge in the rain. When I finally declared my major to be English before summer break, I realized that I had so much more time to dedicate to one of my favorite hobbies. To clarify: I am NOT saying that my major is a stroll in the park or that I have abundant free time. On the contrary, I sometimes feel my brain will combust if I have to generate another original thought for another paper. I simply recognize through my studies how much happier I am, how much more I appreciate stories and how much my vocabulary has improved since picking voracious reading back up.

With all of that being said, I have tracked all the books I read throughout the year and wanted to share **my top picks of 2023.**

1. “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

This is the third time I have read this adventure fiction novel, and I know it’s great because I get something different out of it every time. Coehlo’s masterpiece follows the universal human experience. It’s the story of a shepherd boy named Santiago, but it’s actually the story of a journey to find what each of us was made for. It addresses culture, religion, love and ambition. Written in simple prose, it is a comforting guide to transformation and shows that we are never behind when we are in search of our dreams, one of the greatest treasures we possess. If you are looking for inspiration heading into the new year, I don’t think I could suggest a better book to speak to you.

2. “The Anomaly” by Hervé Le Tellier

This stunning novel, translated from French, perfectly combines science fiction and beautifully written prose to create a narrative full of mystery. It tells the story of several characters on a flight from Paris to New York City that hits a shockingly strong patch of turbulence and lands in the future. As the characters explore their duality in this new world, Le Tellier creates an ingenious thriller that plays with imagination and the laws of the universe. If you desire to get back into reading, this novel will keep you hooked until the last page. 

3. “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Fitzgerald is a master of literary fiction, and I simply cannot get enough. “The Great Gatsby” combines the universal illusions of wealth, love and ambition into an embellished masterpiece of prose. It shows the richness of life lived unapologetically, detailing every in-between moment in childlike awe. The characters explore the profundity of life but seem to recognize that sometimes it means nothing at all. The emotion and intrigue put into every symbol and passing phrase allow the reader to live in an effervescent daydream. If you are looking for a romantic escape from contemporary fiction, look no further.

Limiting myself to only three books was a Herculean task in and of itself, so here are a few of my **honorable mentions**:

“Breakfast at Tiffany’s” by Truman Capote
This quick read features the narration of a low-profile writer as he unfolds his interactions with the eccentric and remarkable Holly Golightly. It recounts the dazzle of the Big Apple in the 1950s and a determined girl going through life on her own terms. 

“The Happiness Project” by Gretchen Rubin
Rubin shares her personal account of becoming a happier human and refusing to let monotony define her year. I implemented some of her strategies into my daily life, and, as each chapter represents a month, it is a great grab for 2024. 

“The Uncontrollability of the World” by Hartmut Rosa
Shockingly, this book was an assigned reading for my persuasive writing class, but I have already given it to my mom and sister to read. Rosa shares in great detail the problem humans have with trying to control every aspect of their lives with endless to-do lists and how, instead, they should allow themselves the liberty to resonate with the world. 

Audiobooks have been my best friend, allowing me to dive into stories while walking to class, so here are three great audiobooks that are easy to listen to on the go:

“Greenlights” by Matthew McConaughey
Narrated brilliantly by McConaughey himself, this unconventional memoir shares all of the experiences he journaled about over the first 50 years of his life to take risks and make his own life his favorite movie. 

“The Twelve Dates of Christmas” by Jenny Bayliss
I am not normally a contemporary romance novel enthusiast, but the organization and pacing of this cute Christmas book mixed with the nontraditional plot were all I wanted for Christmas this year. 

“Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” by Gabrielle Zevin
This book was made for the college audience and broaches the beauties and trials of friendship through time jumps and a cast of clever characters.

Reading continues to be a constant source of happiness, mindfulness and serenity in my life, so I hope that you can find it as life-changing as I do. I don’t think I can say it better than Jane Austen, who shared that “the person, be it gentlemen or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.”
